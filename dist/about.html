      <p class="bio-text">
        I graduated from Florida International University with a bachelors in
        Computer Science. I'm currently getting my Masters in Computer Science
        from FIU. During this time I'm also working as a graduate assistant for
        the Applied Research Center at FIU, specifically under the
        <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://m2m.fiu.edu/"
          >Mission to Market Program </a
        >.
      </p>
      <p class="bio-text">
        I'm mainly interested in the programming and software development side
        of computer science. For the last year and a half I have been working
        with website development technologies such as html, css, javascrit,
        React and some Angular (unfortunately) for frontend development.
      </p>
      <p class="bio-text">
        For backend development I've enjoyed using nodejs, django,
        django-rest-framework and some ASP.NET Core. My favorite framework so
        far has been django for various reasons that I won't get into now.
        Lately, I have devoted a large amount of time learning about machine
        learning because I'm interest in the subject and plan on making it my
        focus for my Ph.D program. During my current time as masters student my
        focus will be on learning more about machine learning/data science and
        how I can incorporate those concepts into the web development projects
        that I do.
